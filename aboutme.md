**Hey, Iâ€™m Elouan Grimm and I love messing around with tech.** I helped [Epimetheus Games](https://epimetheusgamesogpc.itch.io/) out with their first two games, [EyeSore](https://epimetheusgamesogpc.itch.io/eyesore) and [Project Prometheus](https://epimetheusgamesogpc.itch.io/projectprometheus) (you can check em out on [itch](https://epimetheusgamesogpc.itch.io/)). I have been helping out with [@MoeBazziGIT](https://github.com/MoeBazziGIT)'s [Tidy Tab Groups project](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tidy-tab-groups/fohgbkobjdckaapjimleemkolchkmebf) (Hey! Join the Discord [HERE](https://discord.com/invite/aBdAfNfGEv)!!!) I live in Cape Town and speak French and English fluently. I love photography and I take pictures with my crappy phone and post them on [Insta](https://www.instagram.com/elouangrimm).

**Hey, I'm Elouan Grimm** and I love messing around with tech. I helped [Epimetheus Games](https://epimetheus.games/) out with their first two games, *EyeSore* and *Project Prometheus* (you can check em out on [itch](https://epimetheusgamesogpc.itch.io/)). I live in Cape Town and speak French and English fluently. idk what else to add so thats it lol.
